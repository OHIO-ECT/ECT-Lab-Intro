# Install PC Tools

The ITS faculty strongly recomend for each student to have the following tools on their Personal Computer.  These tools simplify communication with the faculty, allow the student to organize knowledge, and produce high quality lab reports.

Students may use different products so long as they can produce equivalent results without support.

## Section 1 - MS Teams and Office tools
    Ohio University purchases licenses from Microsoft Office 365, O365, for every faculty, staff, and student.  O365 includes online and installed PC version of Office, Productivity, and Messaging tools.  These tools are recommended by the ITS department.  The Microsoft Teams messaging tool included in O365 is an excellent tool for communicating with faculty for class work.

    Instructions for downloading and installing O365 can be found at [OIT's Office 365 Help page](https://help.ohio.edu/TDClient/30/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=116)

## Section 2 - Text editor
    The Office 365 tools are good a manipulating text with formatting.  Many of the of the interactions with IT system are still done via text based interfaces, and can be confused by the formatting done by the office tools.  A simple text editor like ``Notepad`` in Windows or ``TextEdit`` in Apple avoids the formatting issues.  Notepad++ is a recommended text editor for ITS classes because it is able to handle nuanced differences in text formats between different operating systems.
    
    If you do not already have a preferred Text Editor, install Notepad++ with the instructions at: <https://notepad-plus-plus.org>
