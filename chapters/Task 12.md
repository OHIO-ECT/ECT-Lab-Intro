## ECT Lab Introduction - Drawing Diagrams

### Goals
-   Configure Remote Desktop to connect to the lab environment
-   Learn the basic setup of the GNS3 virtual lab environment
-   Overview of Windows and Unix operating systems
-   Introduction to the CLI, and the interaction with filesystems
-   Become familiar with the Linux command line terminal (bash shell)

### Pre-Lab
- Homework/Labs/Projects will often have associated ECT Tech Nuggets that are recommended viewing after reading the lab the first time but before starting the work on the lab.  Do **NOT** follow along with the ECT Tech Nuggets while watching them for the first time. Watch the video and use what you have learned. - Windows is the only OS that is officially supported, but other OS's may be possible.

### Toolkit

-   Draw.io or 
### Task 12 - Drawing Diagrams
Drawing what's been built (or will be built) is a crucial skill for network designers. Often a well anotated drawing is far more helpful than a long chart or table filled with boring numbers. Diagrams will show the relationships between network objects (hosts) in a way that words cannot.

Draw.io is the prefered tool for ECT/ITS students. It's free and both webbased and local application based. We recommend [downloading the application and installing it](https://get.diagrams.net). The following steps of this task assume that that user has done this.

1. Start the Draw.io application. Select "Create New Diagram" when prompted. Then select "Blank Diagram". This will open Draw.io to a blank drawing with no stencils (shapes) pre-selected. Once you understand more play with the different options instead of picking "Blank Diagram".
