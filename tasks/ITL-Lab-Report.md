## ECT Lab Introduction - Lab Reports

### Goals
- Configure Remote Desktop to connect to the lab environment
- Learn the basic setup of the GNS3 virtual lab environment
- Overview of Windows and Unix operating systems
- Introduction to the CLI, and the interaction with filesystem
- Become familiar with the Linux command line terminal (bash shell)

### Pre-Lab
- Homework/Labs/Projects will often have associated ECT Tech Nuggets that are recommended viewing after reading the lab the first time but before starting the work on the lab. Do **NOT** follow along with the ECT Tech Nuggets while watching them for the first time. Watch the video and use what you have learned. - Windows is the only OS that is officially supported, but other OS's may be possible. 

### Resources

- Personal Computer (Desktop or Laptop)
- A document you have created to use as a lab notebook
- Assigned gHost (GNS3 Virtual Machine)

### - Lab Reports

Lab Reports are to be written individually (no group work). Reports will be uploaded to Blackboard electronically as a **PDF** (ONLY!). Reports do not generally need to be more than several pages. Officially, they need to be "long enough to answer the questions".

An example lab report format doc can be found here. (https://github.com/OHIO-ECT/ECT-Lab-Introduction/blob/main/files/ITL%20-%20Lab%20Report%20Example.pdf)

Each lab report must have a header (**no cover pages!**) on the first page that includes:
- Student Name
- Lab section attended
- Student program affiliation (CS ugrad, CS grad, ITS ugrad, ITS grad, etc.)
- For terminal window data (ping, traceroute, netstat etc.) data should be formatted with a fixed width font like courier to preserve the columns and displayed as shown on screen.
- Absolutely **NO SCREEN SHOTS!** (with your phone camera or screen shot tool) There are extremely rare cases when a screen shot (usually for a web interface) will be required. This will be noted in the assignment instructions.
- Number your answers with the same numbers as the Lab Report Questions.
- Terminal window (CLI) data needs to be reformatted to remove the extra line breaks. While this report is long future ones will be **much** longer. Removing the extra line breaks will save much space. A smaller font can also be used for terminal window data or adjust margins for that data to stop line wrapping.
