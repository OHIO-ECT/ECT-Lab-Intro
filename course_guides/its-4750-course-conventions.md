## Lab Network Conventions (aka Local Best Practices)
These conventions MUST be used for IP address assignment. These conventions will be in effect for all assignments for the entire semester.
- A1. IPv4 default gateway (Router) will use the last usable address in the IP Network
- A2. IPv6 default gateway (Router) will use ::1 IP
- B. All other static assigned IPs (including other routers that are not the default gateway) start at the beginning of the range
- C. DHCP pools between the statically addressed clients and the Default Gateway
- D. Unless stated otherwise use the following DNS Name servers: 132.235.9.75, 132.235.200.41
 
**HINT:** Think about the "goto" subnet sizes talked about in lecture. Don't over complicate the process.
