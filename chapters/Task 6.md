## ECT Lab Introduction - Terminal Shell and File Management

### Goals
-   Configure Remote Desktop to connect to the lab environment
-   Learn the basic setup of the GNS3 virtual lab environment
-   Overview of Windows and Unix operating systems
-   Introduction to the CLI, and the interaction with filesystems
-   Become familiar with the Linux command line terminal (bash shell)

### Pre-Lab
- Homework/Labs/Projects will often have associated ECT Tech Nuggets that are recommended viewing after reading the lab the first time but before starting the work on the lab.  Do **NOT** follow along with the ECT Tech Nuggets while watching them for the first time. Watch the video and use what you have learned. - Windows is the only OS that is officially supported, but other OS's may be possible.

### Resources

- Personal Computer (Destkop or Laptop)

### Toolkit

-   Shells (i.e. Powershell, Bash)
-   SSH (i.e. Secure Shell)
-   Commands to be typed by the student and output from shells are indicated within this document in the ``fixed width font Courier New`` (as shown here).
-   Varibles to be filled in by the student are presented in ``<brackets>``. The student will need to replace the <> and the text with the needed varible. Example: **My name is ``<Name>``**. Would change to **My name is Bob.**
-   Find a Print Screen / Screen Capture tool that you like. The following is a list of tools known to work:
    -   Lightshot <https://app.prntscr.com>
    -   Greenshot <https://getgreenshot.org>

### Task 6 - Terminal Shell and File Management

1. Open Powershell in Windows or open a Linux Terminal.
<br>

2. Run the command ``pwd`` to get the current working directory of the session.
<br>

3. Open a file explorer and go the same directory as seen in the pwd output. Note the relationship between the files in each location.
<br>

4. Run the Command ``mkdir test`` and then ``cd test``
<br>

5. Notice that test directory will also now appear in the file browser and you can move into that directory.
<br>

6. Start a new document in Notepad++ or your preferred text editor. Copy a couple of lines from <https://hipsum.co> into that file and save the file to the test directory made above.
<br>

7. Use Microsoft Word to create a docx file in this directory with the same text as the text file.
<br>

8. Open a powershell windows and use the ``dir`` or ``ls`` commands in your shell and note the difference in the file sizes.
<br>

9. Use the ``cat <TEXT_FILENAME>`` command to show the raw content of the file.
<br>

10. Cat the word document. What is all that other stuff for?
