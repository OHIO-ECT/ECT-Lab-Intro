# ITS 4750 Labs

Use the following guide to complete a lab report to submit in the Internet Engineering class on Canvas.    

# Report formatting

A significant component of the lab grades involve recording and accuratly documenting systems that are developed during the lab process.  Like many enterprises the Internet Engineering Lab (ITL) requires that its student adopt a specific format.  Information on the required attributes and formatting standards can be found at [ITS Lab Reports](../tasks/ITL-Lab-Report.md)

## Note on variable replacement
Through ALL ITS labs and as a general rule in public documentation various forms of brackets `[ ] < > { }" and quotes are used to signify a variable that must be replaced by the user.  The student is responsible for understanding the context of these strings, but unless otherwise specified the brackets are removed during the replacement.  For example

`{Ohio-University-Mascott}` becomes `bobcat` NOT `{bobcat}`

## Lab Network Conventions (aka Local Best Practices)
These conventions MUST be used for IP address assignment. These conventions will be in effect for all assignments for the entire semester.
- A1. IPv4 default gateway (Router) will use the last usable address in the IP Network
- A2. IPv6 default gateway (Router) will use ::1 IP
- B. All other static assigned IPs (including other routers that are not the default gateway) start at the beginning of the range
- C. DHCP pools between the statically addressed clients and the Default Gateway
- D. Unless stated otherwise use the following DNS Name servers: 132.235.9.75, 132.235.200.41
 
**HINT:** Think about the "goto" subnet sizes talked about in lecture. Don't over complicate the process.
