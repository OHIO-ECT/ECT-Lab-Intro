## Student Lab Tools

### Goals

The ITS faculty strongly recommend for each student to have the following tools on their Personal Computer. These tools simplify communication with the faculty, allow the student to organize knowledge, and produce high quality lab reports. Students may use different products so long as they can produce equivalent results without support.

### Resources

- Personal Computer (Desktop or Laptop)

### Environmental Context

- Personal PC and a browser

### MS Teams and MS Office

Ohio University purchases licenses from Microsoft Office 365, O365, for every faculty, staff, and student. O365 includes online and installed PC version of Office, Productivity, and Messaging tools. These tools are recommended by the ITS department. The Microsoft Teams messaging tool included in O365 is an excellent tool for communicating with faculty for class work.

Instructions for downloading and installing O365 can be found at [OIT's Office 365 Help page](https://help.ohio.edu/TDClient/30/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=116).

### Text Editor

The Office 365 tools are not good a manipulating text with formatting. Many of the of the interactions with IT system are still done via text based interfaces, and can be confused by the formatting done by the office tools. A simple text editor like ``Notepad`` in Windows or ``TextEdit`` in Apple avoids the formatting issues. ``Notepad++`` the recommended text editor for ITS classes because it is able to handle nuanced differences in text formats between different operating systems.

If you do not already have a preferred Text Editor, install Notepad++ with the instructions at: <https://notepad-plus-plus.org>

### Screen Capture Tool 

In most situations in ITS classes, diagrams and graphics work such as network and system diagrams will be created using tools discussed in future labs (Draw.IO). Take note of your instructors specific requirements for various classes. When screen shots are specifically requested, the following tools are able to quickly select a specific region of the screen and maximize the focus on the subject matter.
-   Lightshot <https://app.prntscr.com>
-   Greenshot <https://getgreenshot.org>

**Note:** Photos taken with cell phone will ONLY be acceptable when a student is asked to document physical world work. 

On a Mac there are some options (They have not been fully tested). Not sure what happens when RD Client is full screened and these keys are used.
