# Advanced text editors

There are two main groups of text editors, plain text, and rich text.
Students should have already a grasp on rich text editors like Microsoft
Word, Google Docs, etc. These programs are used to create and manipulate
the look and feel of text in additional to the text itself. Many
computer applications are configured with plain text files which could
be easily corrupted by a rich text editor. Most operating systems have
some form of plain text editor.

-   Notepad - Microsoft Windows

-   Text Editor -- Ubuntu Linux GUI

-   TextEdit -- Mac OSX

There are also several downloadable graphics based plain text editors
that can be downloaded.

-   Notepad++ (Brandon's personal preference) This Window only
    application adds a lot of convenient features include tabbed listing
    of open files, powerful automation features and an understanding of
    a larger set of file encoding systems than the Notepad provided by
    Microsoft.

-   Integrated Development Environments (IDE) many programming languages
    have associated IDEs that understand the language and do extended
    operations on the text like colorization, name completion, and other
    functions that simplify the development of a program in a particular
    language. Visual Studio Code and Eclipse are good examples.
    Notepad++ and Vim also have extensions that allow them to serve as
    IDEs for several languages.

In part because of their history and evolution, operating systems
generally have a command line mechanism for user interaction and the
storage and applications on a computer. These "plain text" interfaces
provide a very "light weight" and feature rich interfaces to their
respective systems. There exist several editors that work in these shell
environments.

-   nano, which is also occasionally referred to as pico, is a compact
    text editor that is geared toward command line interfaces like those
    encountered in Linux terminals. Nano has a very limited Text User
    Interface (TUI) based interface based on control keys.

-   vi or vim (VI enhanced) are the original "visual" text editors
    developed for the Unix and Unix like operating systems. Designed to
    be simultaneous compact and versatile it can be the most confusing
    of text editors. It is installed even on the most minimized of Linux
    distributions. A major part of Vim's complexity comes from the need
    to shift between modes of operation and the lack of a menu system
    like the ones found in the other text editors. This is like the need
    to move between configuration and view modes in VyOS Router
    configuration. The following cheat sheet helps with navigation in
    that system.

1. Experiment with the various text editors including nano and vim in a
    terminal in the gHost machine. Students will need to be able to move
    fluently between the various editors.

2. Use a command line editor create a file in the user home directory.
    Write a sentence or two about your experience in this task. Use the
    appropriate editor commands to write the file to the disk and exit
    the editor. This is a procedure that you will do quite often and
    should become moderately reflexive.

3. Open "Text Editor" in the gHost and open the same file created in
    the previous step. Coordinate a screen shot of the file open in Text
    Editor and the file open in the command line for this step in the
    lab report.
