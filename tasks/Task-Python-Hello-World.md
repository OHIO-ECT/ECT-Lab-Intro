# Develop a Basic Python Script

Stated plainly, a python script is a series of python command placed in a text file which is then executed by the Python interpreter. So, in order to develop a python script, you must type your commands into a text file. By convention, we name these scripts with a ".py" extension. Thus, a file named "hello.py" is a python script.

Any text editor can be used to write a script. You could use Notepad on your Windows computer or nano on a Linux computer. You could even use MS Word and save the program as a text file. But programmers tend to use text editors that are specially designed to be used for programming because those editors come with more features. This task will walk you through using the VS Code editor.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate how to use the VS Code Editor
- Develop a basic program that will prove the Development Environment is functional.
- Run the basic program and observe the results.
- Exfiltrate your program so you can turn it in as part of your assignment.
