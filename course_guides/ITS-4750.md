## Lab Report Questions

1.  From the **Connect to your GNS3 VM** section - **Show** to and from fields and the body text of email to yourself.
<br>

2.  From the **Ethernet Card Data** section - **Show** table created.
<br>

3.  From the **Ping Command** section - **Show** the command used and the first 3 lines of output for each target, and add the average round trip time for each destination on the next line (copy it from the summary line if ping printed one, or calculate it).
<br>

4.  From the **Traceroute Command** section - Using output from tracerout command create a table showing command, hops (IP or hostname), and hop time. In the table **show** the single **longest** delay among all times for each hop. Note that each line (AKA hop) of traceroute output is the results from a new set of probe packets (i.e. times are not always getting longer for later lines in the output). 
<br>

5.  From the **Route Table Commands** section - **Show** the IP address of the router AKA default gateway for each GNS3 guest VMs in the project (i.e. Windows, Ubuntu, etc.) **Hint:** check against traceroute data for verification!
<br>

6.  From the **NSLookup and Dig Commands** - **Show** command and command output for each target, hightlight only the IPv4 address or addresses returned for that particular hostname. The command line version will return additional names and IP addresses; ignore these for now. Highlight only the host name or names returned for that particular IP address.
<br>

7.  From the **Wireshark Data** section - (for help see Lab Writeup Guide and [ECT Tech Nugget N0.5 Wireshark][ECT Tech Nugget N0.5 Basic Diagnostic Tools 5])<br>
    a.  Find packet 58, show the full MAC address (don't let Wireshark hide parts). **Explain** which part of the address identifies the manufacturer of the card. Wireshark may try to "help" you out. Using ONLY the MAC address how can YOU figure out who NIC manufacterer is?<br>
    <br>
    b.  Find DNS data in the capture and **show** entire Wireshark packet output from the packet.
<br>

8. From the **Create a GitHub Account** section - email GitHub account name to instructors. **Show** your Github username in the report.
