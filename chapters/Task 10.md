## ECT Lab Introduction - GitHub Account Creation

### Goals
-   Configure Remote Desktop to connect to the lab environment
-   Learn the basic setup of the GNS3 virtual lab environment
-   Overview of Windows and Unix operating systems
-   Introduction to the CLI, and the interaction with filesystems
-   Become familiar with the Linux command line terminal (bash shell)

### Pre-Lab
- Homework/Labs/Projects will often have associated ECT Tech Nuggets that are recommended viewing after reading the lab the first time but before starting the work on the lab.  Do **NOT** follow along with the ECT Tech Nuggets while watching them for the first time. Watch the video and use what you have learned. - Windows is the only OS that is officially supported, but other OS's may be possible.

### Toolkit

-   Shells (i.e. Powershell, Bash)
-   SSH (i.e. Secure Shell)
-   Commands to be typed by the student and output from shells are indicated within this document in the ``fixed width font Courier New`` (as shown here).
-   Varibles to be filled in by the student are presented in ``<brackets>``. The student will need to replace the <> and the text with the needed varible. Example: **My name is ``<Name>``**. Would change to **My name is Bob.**
-   Find a Print Screen / Screen Capture tool that you like. The following is a list of tools known to work:
    -   Lightshot <https://app.prntscr.com>
    -   Greenshot <https://getgreenshot.org>

### Task 10 - GitHub Account Creation

60. The web page you are viewing is part of a *public* "github repo". However, **all other labs will *not* be public.** In a browser open up www.github.com, create a GitHub account. It **MUST** use your OHIO email address to access the private repos.
<br>

61. Send an email to the course instructors with the new GitHub username. 
<br>

62. You will be unable to access any further labs/repos after this one the GitHub account is created and the information emailed to the instructor.
