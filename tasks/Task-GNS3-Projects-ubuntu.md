## GNS3 Projects

1. Start the GNS3 application with gecko icon in the right hand navigation.

2. Use the "New Blank Project" button from the GNS3 toolbar. The interface that appears has two tabs. The first allow the user to create a new blank project and the second provides a list of projects from this computer "Project Library".

3. Expand the "All Devices" menu from the "Devices Toolbar" on the left hand side of GNS3.

4. Using the network diagram shown in this document connect all the GNS3 objects together. Review [ECT Tech Nugget N1.1 GNS3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5qsM3LhpQI) (scrub to about 6:20) for detailed instructions how to connect objects together in GNS3.

10. Once all the GNS3 VMs have started and are either at a login prompt to a desktop GUI they are ready for use. Please record, in your lab notebook, that child VMs inside GNS3 typically use the username `itsclass` and the password `class115#`.

11. Projects remain running even if the user is NOT connected to the remote desktop connection. This allows the student to break from the lab work and return to the project later.

12. Shutting down GNS3 projects will be discussed on a separate page.
