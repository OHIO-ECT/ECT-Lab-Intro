# ITS 4750 Labs

Use the following guides to complete the question and answer section for the student's ITS 4750 class on Blackboard.

## Note on variable replacement
Through ALL ITS labs and as a general rule in public documentation various forms of brackets `[ ] < > { }" and quotes are used to signify a variable that must be replaced by the user.  The student is responsible for understanding the context of these strings, but unless otherwise specified the brackets are removed during the replacement.  For example

`{Ohio-University-Mascott}` becomes `bobcat` NOT `{bobcat}`
